<h1>Topic Name</h1>Airline Passenger Satisfaction / Airline Performance Appraisal
<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<h2>Business Objectives</h2>
To reduce the percentage of successful fraudulence transactions using fake credit cards within the company.
<h2>Data mining objectives</h2>
To predict the validity of a credit card by utilizing and analyzing historical data pertaining to valid and fraud credit cards
<h1>Data</h1>
<h2>Input</h2>Passenger Demographics, Customer type (Returning, First-Time), Type of Travel (Business, Personal), Flight Class (Business, Economy, Other), Flight Distance, Departure Delay, Arrival Delay, Customer Appraisal on Flight Aspects (ease of booking, cleanliness, overall satisfaction, etc)  
<h2>Output</h2>Predicted Rating of Customer Satisfaction on a Scale of 0 to 5, Identified factors with the lowest customer rating (cleanliness, delays etc) 
<h1>Proposed Methodology</h1>
<h2>Model/Approach</h2>Machine Learning Classification, Linear Regression, Data Vizualization, Anomaly Detection 
<h2>Pipeline</h2>
"Relevant datasets would be downloaded from Kaggle in csv format. Then relevant information from each dataset would be selected, cleaned, and preprocessed. After that, multiple datasets would be combined and the integrated dataset would then be checked for final cleaning to prepare it for use. Each row will represent 1 customer and the columns will be their attributes including demographics, flight information, and flight aspect satisfaction ratings. The dataset will be trained and techniques such as linear regression will be used to determine what the predicted customer satisfaction ratings would be. From there, the model would be evaluated to check its accuracy and integrity. Insights from the model would allow the management to improve the service the company provides to its customers.
